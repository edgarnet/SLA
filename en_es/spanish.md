# Subjectual Language Acquisition: English to Español

## Preface

Before any use of this material, make sure to introduce the alphabet of the language that is being presented. The exercises in this guide are meant to describe the structure of speech used in conversation. They are limited in example, but can be greatly expanded upon. Exercises are to be followed in order, as each segment carefully builds upon the previous one. Each exercise is given a linguistic description for pedagogical purposes, and are NOT meant to be taught to students. Further study could be in the form of (digital) flashcards that can help students build vocabulary and refine grammar. The most effective form of practice is speaking the novel language to classmates and native speakers. The primary goal of this approach is to build confidence in students so that they may become motivated to build fluency by interacting with other speakers.

## The Subject

> Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. - John 8:58

### Introduction

The central figure in this approach to language acquisition is *the Subject*. In every sentence there contains one or multiple subjects that are the topic of discussion.

> Alice went to the park to meet Bob and his fluffy dogs.

The subjects in this sentence include Alice, the Park, Bob, and his Dogs. The reason such characters deserve our attention when speaking is because they determine where the conversation will lead to. Students will more readily follow other speakers if they know what is being discussed. This is not to say they need to memorize nouns, but that they should be able to separate them from verbs and adjectives. Again, we are not concerned with whether they know what a noun, verb, or adjective is, but that they can intuitively parse them out when presented with new modes of speech. For instance, instead of depicting dogs as a noun in a sentence we should ask students: What is being described (in this sentence)? This simple question forces students to filter the sentence for the correct *subject* without knowing any linguistic terminology. Through this approach we attempt to awaken the linguistic parts of the brain that have been laid dormant since childhood.
