# Avoiding the Distributional

Much of what is found in language textbooks is the distillation of language into data structures that are the projection of the software and methodologies of contemporary linguistics and mass communication. Instead of the focus being the acquisition of language, publishers and authors seem only capable of reproducing tables and maps that succinctly define components of a language. What is more perplexing is that many Reference Grammars present their respective languages as a discourse, where these tables and maps play an illustrative role to the conversation at hand. This is partly due to the archival impetus of such Grammars, where the texts serve as a vantage point for a much larger discussion of how a certain language could and should be structured. In other words, a Reference Grammar is merely a collection of varying agendas for the future of an evolving and volatile standard.

It is my contention that language should be presented to students as a discourse. This is largely due to the fact that one's experience with language is itself a temporal discussion concerning the mystery of existence. This conversation concerning mortality, all the words one will ever say in this life, could theoretically be presented as one large [string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)). It should then follow that conversations with other individuals could be concatenated in this *string of life*, and would produce for one hypergraphic an exhaustive biotain. This process could be largely automated by mobile devices recording and transcribing such conversations, where the individuals being recorded would profess all of their thoughts via speech. The eventual use of such enormous collections of data is another matter entirely. What is of immediate interest to our discussion, in this scenario, is the possibility for metadata and indexing to be contingent on parsing the *subjects* of every sentence in the string of one's life.

This approach to understanding is termed *Subjectual*, i.e. comprehension that is contingent on the persons or things mentioned in a sentence. The type of understanding that is relied upon by language textbooks, in contrast, will be called *Distributional*, i.e. comprehension that is contingent on how linguistic units operate. An example of this will rely on the table below:

#### Figure A
| Days of the Week | Translation |
| --- | --- |
| Monday | Lunes |
| Tuesday | Martes |
| Wednesday | Miércoles |
| Thursday | Jueves |
| Friday | Viernes |
| Saturday | Sábado |
| Sunday | Domingo |

We are asked, by these authors, to memorize this type of chart and recollect it when speaking. The issue with this organization of useful elements is that such a diagram does not exist in the minds of fluent speakers. When such charts are introduced in schools of the native tongue, they serve only to assist a child to write that which is already spoken. A child knows that it's Monday not by referencing the top of a similar chart, but by recalling the struggle of waking up after a fun weekend.

This is not to say that every child has the same experience of the dreaded Mondays, but every child has ***a*** perspective of each day of the week based on their own memories, emotions, and desires. It is easier to remember what Friday is by recalling all the thoughts associated with the end of the workweek, than to pull it from an impersonal table. The problem with relying too heavily on the language acquisition of childhood is in the form of another data structure: a map.

Some, if no most, individuals store many of the phrases they say on a routine basis by associating a request or answer to a specific string. The way this would be emulated in a Distributional setting is as follows:

#### Figure B
```
{ 
    "Greetings":
    [
        "Hello":        "Hola",
        "How are you?": "¿Cómo Estás?",
        "Good morning": "Buenos días",
        "Good evening": "Buenas noches",
        "Goodbye":      "Adiós"
    ],
    "Questions":
    [
        "¿Habla inglés?":       "Do you speak English?",
        "¿Cómo te llamas?":     "What's your name?",
        "¿Dónde está el baño?": "Where is the restroom?"
    ]
}
```

Students are often presented such phrases as the "most common" in order to get them speaking immediately. The obvious problem with such introductions being the student is unable to follow up in any conversation, and becomes dissuaded from speaking just as quickly. The more delayed consequence of acquiring language in such a manner is the inability for speakers to construct more complex, conceptual statements. This can be seen in native speakers that operate solely on a more intricate, yet shallow map not too dissimilar from Figure B. 

What we should instead present to students is an iterative process that cements the grammar of a language at a subliminal level. Many students may not have the desire to produce statements of intellectual prowess, but when confronted with an unfamiliar situation they should be capable of constructing appropriate phrases. This will be possible partially by making the focus of instruction revolve around the *subject* and its relationship to grammar. In order for students to respond adequately, they must follow what is being said and, more importantly, identify the topics a conversation could lead to. This will prepare them to think of possible responses before they eventually reply, and allow them to grow from the classroom and rely solely on feedback from peers and native speakers.
