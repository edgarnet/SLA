# Against Verbiage

When a novel language is presented to adult students it is often described using verbose terminology native only to linguistics. While these concepts are appropriate in a strictly academic setting, it is not necessary nor conducive to language acquisition for habitual speech. Most people in their native tongue are unable to describe basic grammatical categories, yet are able to point out incorrect speech when heard. This is because such 'rules' are acquired during childhood through constant trial and error whether at home, school, or play. As children, individuals are permitted to experiment with language while being corrected by parents, teachers, and peers as they approach new modes of speech. These interactions are bidirectional; the child after experimenting and being corrected, is then able to play the role of critic to other peers or siblings. This is the functional reason as to why children appear to adopt language more readily than adults.

The advantage adults have when acquiring a new language is their ability to rely on analogs in their native tongue. The most intricate use of this technique is known as language transfer. The main issue with this approach is the reliance on similar enough grammar and vocabulary between the native and novel language. In order to avoid the pitfalls of negative language transfer, we should approach language as a tool to express thoughts and emotions that are not contingent on language itself. This will produce the motivation necessary for successful language acquisition to occur. The native language still has utility in establishing meaning and presenting concepts, but the focus should be to encourage students to rely on the novel language to express their ideas and intentions.

The days of the week, for example, are often tied to a social custom or obligation that is habitual, ritual even, that develops into a collection of memories that serve as the emotional foundation for this set of vocabulary. We will attempt to emulate this process by making the study of language a series of exercises that are repeated heavily and grow gradually before new concepts are introduced. Interactions with classmates and native speakers will help correct and reinforce novel concepts and aid in the ritual aspect of this approach to language acquisition. Such interactions are not improved or helped by academic explanations, and only serve to confuse the majority of students who care not *how* they learn. This is not to say instructors should be unaware of the linguistic components of what is being learned, but that such explanations should be avoided when conducting exercises with students.
